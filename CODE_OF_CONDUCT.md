# Code of conduct

Welcome to Renaissance Innovation Labs. Renaissance Innovation Labs is
committed to providing a welcoming and safe environment for people of
all races, gender identities, gender expressions, sexual orientations,
physical abilities, physical appearances, socio-economic backgrounds,
nationalities, ages, religions, and beliefs.

The Renaissance Innovation Labs community principles are:

- **Be friendly and patient.** Be generous and kind in both giving and
  accepting critique. Critique is a natural and important part of our
  culture. Good critiques are kind, respectful, clear, and constructive,
  focused on goals and requirements rather than personal preferences.
  You are expected to give and receive criticism with grace. Be
  considerate in speech and actions, and actively seek to acknowledge
  and respect the boundaries of fellow attendees.

- **Be welcoming.** We strive to be a community that welcomes and
  supports people of all backgrounds and identities. Some examples of
  behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

  - Using welcoming and inclusive language.

  - Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.

  - Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.

  - Showing empathy towards other community members.

  - Placing collective interest before your own interest.

- **Be considerate.** Your work will be used by other people, and you in
  turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will
  affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences
  into account when making decisions.

- **Be respectful.** Not all of us will agree all the time, but
  disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might
  all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that
  frustration to turn into a personal attack. It’s important to remember
  that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not
  a productive one.

- **Be careful in your word choice.** Be kind to others. Do not insult
  or put down others. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren't
  acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:

  - Violent threats or language directed against another person.

  - Discriminatory jokes and language.

  - Posting sexually explicit or violent material.

  - Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally
    identifying information ("doxing").

  - Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.

  - Unwelcome sexual attention.

  - Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.

  - Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to
    stop, then stop.

- **Assume all communications are positive.** Always remain polite, and
  assume good faith. It is surprisingly easy to misunderstand each
  other, be it online or in person, particularly in such a culturally
  diverse setting as ours. Misunderstandings are particularly easy to
  arise when we are in a rush, or otherwise distracted. Please ask
  clarifying questions before assuming that a communication was
  inappropriate.

- **When we disagree, try to understand why.** Disagreements, both
  social and technical, happen easily and often. It is important that we
  resolve such disagreements and differing views constructively. At
  times it can be hard to appreciate a viewpoint that contradicts your
  own perceptions. Instead of pushing back, try to understand where the
  other person is coming from, and don’t be afraid to ask questions. You
  can be most helpful if your own replies serve to clarify, rather than
  to escalate an issue. Also don’t forget that it can be easy to make
  mistakes, and allow for the possibility that the mistake may have been
  yours. When this happens it is better to resolve the issue together,
  and to learn from the experience together, than to place blame.
