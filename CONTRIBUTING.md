6. Create a pull request (PR) from your forked repository to the main
   repository on GitHub.

## Setting Up the Development Environment

If you're planning to make code changes, it's essential to set up your
development environment:

1. Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) if you haven't
   already. You can download them from the
   [official website](https://nodejs.org/).

2. Install project dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

## Testing

Before submitting a pull request, make sure to run tests to ensure your
changes do not introduce new issues and that the existing functionality
remains intact:

```sh
npm test
```

## Submitting a Pull Request

When you're ready to submit your changes, follow these steps:

1. Ensure your code changes pass all tests.

2. Create a descriptive pull request (PR) explaining the purpose and
   details of your changes.

3. Include any relevant documentation updates.

4. Submit the PR for review.

## Code Review

Your pull request will undergo code review by the maintainers. Be
prepared to address any feedback or requested changes. Once the PR is
approved, it will be merged into the main branch.

# If you are reporting a problem

- Describe exactly what you were trying to achieve, what you did, what
  you expected to happen and what did happen instead. Include relevant
  information about the platform, OS version etc. you are using. Include
  shell commands you typed in, log files, errors messages etc.

- Please open a separate issue for each problem, question, or comment
  you have. Do not re-use existing issues for other topics, even if they
  are similar. This keeps issues small and manageable and makes it much
  easier to follow through and make sure each problem is taken care of.
